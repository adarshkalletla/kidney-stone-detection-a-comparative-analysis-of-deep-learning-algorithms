Abstract—Healthcare sector is a broad field offering diverse
 facilities which includes diagnosis of medical issues, offering
 advanced treatments and surgeries to ensure the wellness of
 a patient. Due to the ever increasing health issues, there are
 lot of new challenges encountered by the medical sector. To
 overcome this challenges, deep learning techniques have become
 an integral part of the medical field aiding in medical image
 analysis offering valuable insights for diagnosis of diseases.
 Kidney Stone detection involves deep learning models to analyse
 the Computed tomography scans of patients to accurately identify
 the of kidney stones. The models are trained using various
 pre-processed cross-sectional CT scans of each patient, allowing
 the model to comprehensively analyze and learn from diverse
 imaging data for enhanced diagnostic accuracy and effectiveness
 in detecting and classifying into kidney stones , cysts, tumors and
 normal conditions along with the identification of kidney stone
 sizes.
